# cwa-lib
Provides lightweight core web application libraries including a logger, database layer, and MVC framework.

To start quickly, begin with either the [Core Web Application Site](https://github.com/chriswells0/cwa-site) or [Core Web Application Blog](https://github.com/chriswells0/cwa-blog) project. Both use these libraries to build a fully functional web site.
